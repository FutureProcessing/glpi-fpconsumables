# glpi-fpconsumables
GLPI plugin that allows you to preview consumables at user profile page.
##General Information

Current solution for Consumables doesn’t allow to verify which consumables were given to a user. FP Consumables solved that problem and introduces new tab that lists all consumables that were given to a user.
